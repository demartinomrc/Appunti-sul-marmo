	Abstract = {Conventional methods of `quadraphonic' reproduction may not convey the original sound field to best advantage. The studio techniques for ambisonics and its applications are discussed, in the light of both accepted `quadraphonic' techniques, and the requirements of further accurate reproduction of the sound field. Areas of compatibility and of disparity are discussed, to be read in the light of Peter Fellgett's system description (Studio Sound, Vol. 17, pp. 20-22, 40 (August 1975).},
